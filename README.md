# Number Guessing Game (JavaScript)

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number. The game gives feedback whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number until the correct guess is made.

## How to Play

2. You will be prompted to enter a guess between 1 and 100.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is:
   - Greater than the actual number
   - Smaller than the actual number
   - Correct
4. The game will also keep track of the number of attempts you take to guess the number correctly.
